# Lua Projects

Welcome to the Lua Projects repository! This is a collection of various Lua scripts and projects I've created. Feel free to explore and learn from the code(don't actually, this code is terrible and shouldn't be used for educational purposes)

## Projects

- **Totally Fair Rock Paper Scissors**: A Rock Paper Scissors game where you play against me(totally not rigged 100% fr, took me a while to make in Lua lol)
