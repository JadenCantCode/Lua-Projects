# Lua Projects

Welcome to the Lua Projects repository! This is a collection of various Lua scripts and projects I've created. Feel free to explore and learn from the code(don't actually, this code is terrible and shouldn't be used for educational purposes)

## Projects

- **Totally Fair Rock Paper Scissors**: A Rock Paper Scissors game where you play against me(totally not rigged 100% fr, took me a while to make in Lua lol)

## I AM FAIRLY NEW TO CODING

Keep in mind that I(the number 1 alpha sigma) am very new to coding. so like ***with rizz*** dont ***with rizz*** bully me or something ***with rizz of course***
